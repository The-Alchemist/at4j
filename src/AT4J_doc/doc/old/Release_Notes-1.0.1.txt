Release 1.0.1, 2009.03.19
================================================================================
AT4J is a set of tools for working with data compression and file archives from
Java. It supports reading and creating Zip and Tar files, as well as several
types of compression algorithms via third party libraries.

This release fixes two bugs that made the TarExtractor and the ArchiveExtractor
not work properly on locking file systems. EntityFS and the Apache Commons
Compress bzip2 dependencies are updated to their latest versions.
