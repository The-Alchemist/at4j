<title>bzip2 compression</title>
<para>The bzip2 compression method was developed by Julian Seward in the
late nineties. See the
<xref linkend="bib_wikipedia_article_on_bzip2"/> and the
<xref linkend="bib_bzip2_home_page"/>.</para>

<para>&At4J; provides a Java implementation of bzip2. Data is compressed with
the org.at4j.comp.bzip2.BZip2OutputStream and decompressed with the
org.at4j.comp.bzip2.BZip2InputStream.</para>

<para>Since bzip2 compression is a CPU-intensive task, the
org.at4j.comp.bzip2.BZip2OutputStream supports using several, parallel
compression threads. An individual org.at4j.comp.bzip2.BZip2OutputStream may be
told how many threads that it can use, or several output streams may share a
set of threads through a org.at4j.comp.bzip2.BZip2EncoderExecutorService.</para>

<para>The following example shows how data is written to a bzip2 output stream
that writes to a file, and then read again from the file and decompressed.

</example></para>

<para>Next example shows how a set of encoder threads is shared between two
bzip2 streams.

<title>Compressing and decompressing with bzip2 using several encoder threads</title>
<programlisting>&ex_cad_bzip2_w_encoder_threads;</programlisting>
</example></para>

<para>&At4J; also bundles the bzip2 library from the
<xref linkend="bib_commons_compress_site"/> project. It provides the 
org.apache.commons.compress.compressors.bzip2.BZip2CompressorInputStream for
reading compressed data and the
org.apache.commons.compress.compressors.bzip2.BZip2CompressorOutputStream for
writing compressed data.</para>

<para>Note that the <computeroutput>available</computeroutput> method of the
org.apache.commons.compress.compressors.bzip2.BZip2CompressorInputStream always
returns <computeroutput>0</computeroutput>.</para>

<para>The org.at4j.comp.bzip2.BZip2ReadableFile and
org.at4j.comp.bzip2.BZip2WritableFile objects can transparently bzip2
decompress or compress data that is read from or written to a file. They implement the
org.entityfs.ReadableFile and the org.entityfs.WritableFile interfaces
respectively and can be passed to all methods that use those interfaces.</para>

<para>The next example does the same as the example above, except that it uses
the org.at4j.comp.bzip2.BZip2ReadableFile and 
org.at4j.comp.bzip2.BZip2WritableFile classes.

<para>The org.at4j.comp.bzip2.prog.BZip2 and org.at4j.comp.bzip2.prog.BUnzip2
classes have runnable main methods that emulate the behavior of the
<computeroutput>bzip2</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>bunzip2</computeroutput>
commands. See their API documentation for details on how to use them.</para>
