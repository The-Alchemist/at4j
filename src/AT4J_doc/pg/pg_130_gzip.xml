<title>gzip compression</title>
<para>gzip is a compression format that was created by Jean-Loup Gailly and
Mark Adler in the early nineties. See the
<xref linkend="bib_wikipedia_article_on_gzip"/>.</para>

<para>gzip is supported through Java's java.util.zip.GZipOutputStream and
java.util.zip.GZipInputStream. They filter the data sent to or read from another
stream to compress it and decompress it, respectively.</para>

<para>&EntityFS; has with the org.entityfs.util.io.GZipReadableFile and
org.entityfs.util.io.GZipWritableFile classes. They can transparently
decompress data read from a file and compress data written to a
file.

<para>The org.at4j.comp.gzip.prog.GZip and org.at4j.comp.gzip.prog.GUnzip classes have
runnable main methods that emulate the behavior of the
<computeroutput>gzip</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>gunzip</computeroutput>
commands. See their API documentation for details on how to use them.</para>
